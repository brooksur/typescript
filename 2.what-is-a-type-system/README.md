# 2. What is a Type System?

## Type

Easy way to refer to the different properties + functions that a value has.

## Why do we care?

- Types are used by the Typescript Compiler to analyze our code for errors.
- Types allow other engineers to understand what values are flowing around our codebase.

## Type Categories

- Primitive Types: number, string, boolean, etc..
- Object Types: functions, arrays, classes, objects, custom..

## Type Annotations vs. Inference

- Annotation is code we add to tell typescript what type of value a variable will refer to
- Inference is when we let typescript try to figure out what type of value a variable refers
